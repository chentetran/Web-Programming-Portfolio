The appropriate images displaying at the corresponding screen widths were
correctly implemented. This was all done in the CSS file.

The images seem to move around, despite choosing the mathematically logical
coordinates to select the image from the sprite sheet. I adjusted the 
coordinates by a few pixels, but the images still move around a bit.

I discussed this assignment with Michele Mei.

I spent about half an hour on this lab.
