The lyrics and images have been set up successfully to show up at the right times according to the music video.

I was confused as to how to create a folder inside a git repo, so I am missing a few commits due to Git not understanding what I wanted to do. So, the first official commit to include the files of this lab was "moved folder back in", but I had been attempting to commit prior.

I spent about an hour on this assignment.

I discussed this assignment with Michele Mei.
